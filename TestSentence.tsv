2934	0	We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.
2935	0	Terms of Service
2936	0	"This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at https://telegram.org/tos"
2937	0	This Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.
2938	0	Table of Contents
2939	0	This Privacy Policy explains the following:
2940	0	the legal basis for processing your personal data;
2941	0	what personal data we may collect from you;
2942	0	how we keep your personal data safe;
2943	0	what we may use your personal data for;
2944	0	who your personal data may be shared with; and
2945	0	your rights regarding your personal data.
2946	0	"If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services"
2947	0	"However, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data."
2948	0	Legal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data
2949	0	" (1) providing effective and innovative Services to our users; and (2) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data."
2950	0	Basic Account Data
2951	0	Telegram is a communication service
2952	0	"To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public"
2953	0	We do not require your screen name to be your real name
2954	0	Note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name
2955	0	"This way your mother can have the public name ＆Johnny Depp＊ while appearing as ＆Mom＊ to you and as ＆Boss＊ to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured)."
2956	0	Your E-mail Address
2957	0	"When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email"

2959	0	That's right: no marketing or ※we miss you§ bullshit.
2960	0	Telegram is a cloud service
2961	0	All data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions
2962	0	This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.
2963	0	Secret chats use end-to-end encryption
2964	0	This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know
2965	0	There is no way for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages
2966	0	We do not store your secret chats on our servers
2967	0	"We also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats"
2968	0	For the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud 〞 you can only access those messages from the device they were sent to or from.
2969	0	Media in Secret Chats
2970	0	"When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server"
2971	0	"This key and the file＊s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat＊s key 〞 and sent to your recipient"
2972	0	They can then download and decipher the file
2973	0	"This means that the file is technically on one of Telegram＊s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient"
2974	0	We don＊t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to
2975	0	We periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.
2976	0	"In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups"
2977	0	All public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.1.1 above)
2978	0	"Like everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit 〞 but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone."
2979	0	Phone Number and Contacts
2980	0	Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph
2981	0	We ask your permission before syncing your contacts.
2982	0	Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram
2983	0	"When you open the ＆Invite friends＊ interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram."
2984	0	You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings.
2985	0	"If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG)"
2986	0	"If you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code"
2987	0	The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web
2988	0	We do not use cookies for profiling or advertising
2989	0	"The cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience"
2990	0	"Your browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them"
2991	0	"You may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web."
2992	0	Keeping Your Personal Data Safe
2993	0	"If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands"
2994	0	These are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space
2995	0	"However, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram"
2996	0	"As such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers"
2997	0	All data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.
2998	0	End-to-End Encrypted Data
2999	0	"Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient"
3000	0	"Before this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient"
3001	0	"While Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient 每 or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information"
3002	0	"In this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don＊t have."
3003	0	Processing Your Personal Data
3004	0	Telegram is a cloud service
3005	0	"We will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage."
3006	0	Safety and Security
3007	0	Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations
3008	0	Telegram also has more than 200 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers

3011	0	"If a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers 每 temporarily or permanently"
3012	0	You can send an appeal using @Spambot
3013	0	"In case of more serious violations, your account may be banned"
3014	0	We may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.
3015	0	We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.
3016	0	" For example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen"
3017	0	"To do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently"
3018	0	A similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with ※@§)
3019	0	"To turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings and disable ※Suggest Frequent Contacts§."
3020	0	"Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes"
3021	0	Telegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.
3022	0	Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots
3023	0	"Bots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special ※inline§ interface to access their features"
3024	0	"By performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers."
3025	0	How Bots Can Receive Data
3026	0	You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:
3027	0	By sending messages to a bot.

3032	0	What Data Bots Receive
3033	0	"In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s)."
3034	0	Bots can also receive the following data when you interact with them.
3035	0	Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.
3036	0	"If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member."
3037	0	When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g
3038	0	@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot
3039	0	This query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service
3040	0	We will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.
3041	0	Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access
3042	0	"If the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group"
3043	0	The interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.

3057	0	Your credit card information never reaches Telegram＊s servers
3058	0	We do not access and do not store your credit card information
3059	0	"When you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a token that you can reuse for future payments"

3061	0	7.3 Shipping Information

3066	0	"If you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store."
3067	0	"Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks 每 any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange."

3090	0	"In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too."
3091	0	" Otherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history"
3092	0	This means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner＆s message history
3093	0	"As soon as your partner deletes it too, it＊s gone forever."
3094	0	"As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides"
3095	0	There is no time limit
